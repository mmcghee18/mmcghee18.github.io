        <p>
          As a core engineer at a small (10-15 people) startup, I built and
          iterated on Resource's web app, heavily using React, GraphQL/Apollo,
          Node.js, and MongoDB. I debugged customer issues, took new features
          from start to finish (often including design work), and led improv
          games at our weekly team meetings.
